I am a jr. software developer from Argentina, Rosario. Currently a **Computer Science** Bachelor's student, I have a 3-year technical degree in **Systems Analysis**.

I’ve studied **low-level** programming languages like C and topics like memory management, data structures, computational complexity, etc. I also learned technologies like SQL, JavaScript, PHP to build **full-stack systems**. I think one of my strengths is being organized, prioritazing code documentation and readability and trying to understand how things work.

I am a native Spanish speaker with a First Certificate in English (B2 Level) and I'm used to coding and learning in English.

Currently I'm revisiting/refactoring my own previous academic projects, as well as learning new things in the process.

# PROJECTS

## Random Word Search Generator
#### C, Python

This is a CLI app that **generates a pseudo-random word search out of the user's input**.

It uses a *dynamic programming*, *backtracking* algorithm to determine if it's possible to fill all the necessary words in a given space.

This was one of my first projects, and an introduction to topics like C memory management, algorithms, computational complexity and the usage of a wide range of Python features like error handling, OOP, pytest, etc.

## Coding Algorithms and Data Structures
#### Python

This is a collection of various **algorithm problems** I solved for practice.

The idea was to gain experience programming all sorts of algorithms, involving different logical/maths problems, data structures, iterative/recursive algorithms, DP (memoization, tabulation), backtracking, etc.

Also, to be able to put into practice theoretical concepts studied in Computer Science, like computational complexity and practical efficiency.
